<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are some good N-Back Tests available online; however, none of them fitted my needs, so I created this N-Back Test that can run as a
stand-alone program that doesn't require network to keep collected data secure.

Here's why you should use my N-Back program:
* It includes a practice round, 2-Back, and 3-Back test
* It saves by a text file you can create
* It provides 4 options that you can change about the test. The amount of trials, the amount of matches in those tests, the number of seconds the
letter will appear, and the interval between each appearing letter.

1. Pick/create a directory to place the test results in. (When students do the test, they're prompted to make a text file under a directory, where the n-back test will edit to show test results. You may instruct them to put the text file under your chosen directory.)
2. Unzip n-back.zip into the C: Drive.
3. After unzipping, go into the unzipped folder under the C: Drive. The folder should be named "n-back".
4. Run the shortcut named "Click me to run", and it should run the full n-back test.
5. To adjust the settings of the test, right-click on "Click me to run", and go into its properties. You can adjust the settings of the n-back test under "Target".

![4dc27c87-3c94-41d8-991b-2b9adaa3c50e](https://github.com/krazyness/n-back-test/assets/138156236/f0b3989d-f91e-4422-91e7-514ff4819582)

The text under "Target" should say "C:\n-back\n-back.exe --trials 25 --matches 7 --letterduration 0.75 --pause 2"

The number after "--trials" correlates to the number of trials in the n-back tests.

The number after "--matches" correlates to the minimum number of n-back matches in each test.

The number after "--letterduration" correlates to the amount of time (in seconds) the letter will appear during the n-back test.

The number after "--pause" correlates to the interval (in seconds) between each letter appearing.
